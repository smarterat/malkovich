##Malkovich?
Malkovich is a playful remix of [Torbjörn Söderstedt's](http://torso.me) hilarious programming language [Chicken](http://torso.me/chicken). The Chicken language has only one valid symbol: chicken. Similar to other such [esoteric](https://github.com/pksunkara/semicolon) languages, it works by manipulating the program stack.

For more on Chicken, you can read Torbjörn's [paper](http://isotropic.org/papers/chicken.pdf) or view his [presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL_-1d9OSdk). The [specification](http://torso.me/chicken-spec) for Chicken also holds true for Malkovich. Unless it isn't entirely clear: I did not create this language, I only modified the symbol to "Malkovich."

##Malkovich!
This remix is an homage to a particular scene from the movie [Being John Malkovich](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601/). It just so happened that I was re-watching the film when I came across Chicken and one thing led to another...
